# Database Design

## Purpose

This is the canonical data-architecture document for ArginAccounting.

## Principles

- Domain and application layers remain database-independent.
- SQLite is the first production persistence engine; PostgreSQL is a future target.
- Gregorian UTC timestamps are stored internally. Jalali conversion belongs to presentation and input boundaries.
- Monetary values use integer minor units or explicitly defined decimal precision; binary floating point is prohibited.
- Every tenant-owned record carries company scope and, where applicable, branch scope.
- Foreign keys, unique constraints, checks, and indexes enforce invariants close to the data.
- Posted financial records and audit history are immutable; corrections use explicit reversal or amendment workflows.
- Optimistic concurrency protects mutable aggregate roots.

## Naming

Tables and columns use English `snake_case`. Primary keys use stable identifiers. Foreign keys follow `<entity>_id`. Timestamps use `_at`; dates use `_date`.

## Migrations

Migrations are ordered, immutable after release, idempotent where practical, and applied inside controlled startup flows. Destructive changes require a migration plan, backup guidance, and rollback strategy.

## Indexing

Indexes are driven by real query paths. Company, branch, fiscal year, status, document number, date, correlation ID, and foreign-key access paths must be reviewed for each module.

## Transactions

Use explicit Unit of Work boundaries for operations that write multiple aggregates, history records, audit entries, number-series values, or posting results.

## Future Compatibility

SQL dialect-specific logic must stay inside infrastructure packages. Domain contracts must not expose SQLite-specific types or syntax.
